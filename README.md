# My Portfolio

This is the readme for my online portfolio, which can be found at http://www.dylanrichard.tech. Here, I talk about the skills I have as a fullstack developer, and the many projects I have completed, with their links, and their Github repository links as well. You can also reach me on LinkedIn from there as well.
